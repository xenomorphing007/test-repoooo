## üå≥ About Endless Forest

[**Endless Forest**](https://inspiring-lovelace-c7ca1c.netlify.app/) is a platform game based on an endless runner genre. You may have heard about Temple Run, Subway Surfer, and other similar games. Although Endless Forest is a 2D game, it falls in a similar genre with those games.

The story behind [**Endless Forest**](https://inspiring-lovelace-c7ca1c.netlify.app/) is about a Knight walking peacefully, but little did he know, he entered the [**Endless Forest**](https://inspiring-lovelace-c7ca1c.netlify.app/). Filled with obstacles and monsters, the knight tries to survive by dodging the obstacles and killing the monsters.

The more time survived the highest score.

I implemented a leaderboard showing the Top 5 Ranking High Scores and the rank and score of the current player.

## üìê About The Project
Endless Forest is a Phaser 3 project with ES6 support via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) that includes hot-reloading for development and production-ready builds.

This has been updated for Phaser 3.50.0 version and above.

## üìù Game Instructions

For the Knight to be able to survive you need to dodge obstacles and kills monsters.

**To Jump** over obstacles you can use these following keys

```
    ‚å®Ô∏è 'W' or 'SPACEBAR'
```

**To Attack** monsters you can use these following keys

```
    ‚å®Ô∏è 'A' or  üñ±Ô∏è 'LEFT MOUSE BUTTON'
```

**To Drop** faster (like Subway Surfer) you can use these following keys

```
    ‚å®Ô∏è 'S' or  üñ±Ô∏è 'RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON'
```

**Other**

The `ENTER` key is used for basic interaction within the game. These basic interaction includes **skip boot scene, start game, submit leaderboard nickname, skip credits scene, etc**.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Built With Phaser 3

#### üïπÔ∏è [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io)

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup
### Requirements
Internet Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

### Installation

After installing the tools required, go ahead and clone this repository by using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) commands.

```
    git clone https://github.com/jcy2704/endless-forest.git
```

Or you can also download this repository and access it with navigation commands.

```
    cd /path/to/repository/endless-forrest
```

To be able to run the game smoothly you need to install Node dependencies by typing the following command on your terminal

```
    npm install
```

Now you are good to go!

### Run Endless Forest

Now that you've installed the repository correctly. Go ahead and test it out by running the following command on the terminal

```
    npm start
```

This command will open a `localhost:8080` server where it will be running the game until you close the server by using the key combo `CTRL + C` on the terminal.

And there you are running the game.

**Enjoy!**

## Making Your Own Changes
### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm start` | Build project and open web server running project |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

### Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080` by default).

### Deploying Code

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle located at `dist/bundle.min.js` along with any other assets you project depended.
